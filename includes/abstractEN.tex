In this bachelor thesis we are developing a three-layer web application focused
for e-learning mathematics, specifically probability and statistics. The aim of the work was to
to design and implement a user-oriented frontend using the Angular framework,
using the Bootstrap and Material UI libraries to provide an intuitive
editing. On the other hand, the backend of the application was developed using Node.js and the framework
Next.js framework in order to provide efficient data processing and application logic. With PostgreSQL
database, we worked on storing and processing user data and content. The entire apli-
Finally, the entire application is deployed in Docker containers, which allows for easier distribution
and deployment of the application. The result is a comprehensive e-learning platform that enables
learners to test their knowledge through tests, assignments and study materials,
and also analyse their progress and development. This project represents an important step towards
modern pedagogical methods that use technological innovation to improve
education.
